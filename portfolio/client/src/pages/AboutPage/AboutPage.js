      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        Born in Saint-Nazaire, a little city on the North-Western coast of
        France, I am now residing in Fuerteventura, Spain.
      </p>

      <h2>My story</h2>

      <p>
        I enrolled at University and graduated in Business and languages at age
        20. But I always had a dream: see the world. That's how I spent the next
        10 years around the world, exploring and experiencing life abroad, far
        from home.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>

      <p>
        The desire for freedom has brought me to the world of web development. I
        wanted a job that keeps me out of my routine and comfort zone, always
        teaching me and allowing me to be create great things, to think outside
        the box. I started coding as a hobby first and then decided to build a
        career out of it!
