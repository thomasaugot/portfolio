      <h1>About me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        I was born in Saint-Nazaire, a little city on the North-Western coast of France, and grew up
        in a little nearby town.

      <h2>&nbsp;My story</h2>

      <p>
        I enrolled at University and graduated in Business and languages at age 20. But I always had
        a dream: see the world. That's how I spent the next 10 years around the world, exploring and
        experiencing life abroad, far from home. I am now residing in the sunny Fuerteventura,
        Spain.

      <h2>&nbsp;Why Web Development?</h2>

      <p>
        The constent need of freedom has brought me to the world of web development. I wanted a
        flexible job that keeps me out of my routine and comfort zone, always teaching me and
        allowing me to create great things, to think outside the box. I started coding as a hobby
        first and then decided to build a career out of it. In a world where everything becomes
        digital, I really feel like I can contribute in a meaningful way, for example by helping in
        increasing businesses online visibility.
